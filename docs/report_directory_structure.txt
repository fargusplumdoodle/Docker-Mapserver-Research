Report directory structure documentation
---------------------------------------

I realize this must be confusing if it is not explained.

All paths here ar relative to "docker-mapserver/test/load_testing"

Reports Directory structure:
    ./reports: contains all of the host directories
    ./reports/<host>: contains all of the tests for this host
    ./reports/<host>/<test_name>/: contains all of the files related to the test

Report files:
    - dstat.csv: generated on the server, contains all of the host resource usage information
    - graph.png: generated by ./scripts/Graph.py, contains system usage information
    - <testplan>.jmx: A copy of the test plan used for this test, so it can be recreated
    - jmeter.csv: generated by jMeter on the client. Has all of the client side data about
                   the performance of the server
    - jmeter.log: the output of jMeter during the dest
    - stats.txt: contains a list of summerized information about the test
