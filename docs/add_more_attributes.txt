# Adding More Attributes to scan

In this project, attribute refers to a property or datapoint summarized from
a load test.

## Procedure:

1. Determine what the attribute you want to add is and how to calculate it.
   Add a detailed description in "docs/load_test_attribute_definitions.txt"

2. If the your attribute can be calculated from jmeter data, add a function
   to the AnalyzeJmeter class in "./scripts/analyze_jmeter.py". if its from
   dstat, edit the AnalyzeDstat class in "./scripts/analyze_dstat.py".

   Your function name should start with "get" and be descriptive.

3. Edit  "scripts/analyze_report.py" in step 4 the "stats" object is created
   just add your attribute name as a key and call the function you created
   from either "./scripts/analyze_jmeter.py" or "./scripts/analyze_dstat.py".
